            <h2 class="intro">What am I doing now?</h2>
            <p>As of right now, I am working for a company called Sykes. This company contracts out with other companies, but at the heart is a call center. I am currently working with another company called Viasat, a satellite internet company, through Sykes. As most of us know, recently it has been a pretty crazy world, so internet has become more important than ever for consumers due to having to work from home and do virtual schooling. For Viasat, I work as a Technical Trouble Shooter, and I assist customers with their internet/device problems. It has been a learning experience thus far, and I feel that this will help me to be better at my career as IT once I finish my degree next August (2021).</p>
            <p>As for gaming, I stream on Twitch and play with a competitive League of Legends team. In the past, I started playing games once I graduated High School, and since then have played in several competitive and professional environments. The first professional scene I played in was for Halo 3, and this is where my passion began. Back then, I played with all the popular names, and some of them are even big streamers on Twitch today, such as Ninja! From here, I went to playing in competitive scenes for games like Gears of War and League of Legends. The most recent professional scene I played in was for a game called Ring of Elysium, and it was another experience I am proud to have been apart of, but has since died out.</p>
            <p>My overall dream is to become a big streamer like so many others in my past, and make a living that way. I do enjoy playing in the competitive/professional scenes because I am a competitive person at heart, but I also realize I am getting older, and it is becoming harder to stay on top with all the new young talent coming into the scene. At the end of the day, if I could take my streaming career to the next level and turn it into my main form of income one day, that would be awesome! Until then, finishing my IT degree and working around the eSports scene is more than enough to satisfy my competitive itch.
